### Process for Change Request and Solution Proposals

The CCB currently adopted the below process to address Change Requests. First, a change request is used to describe the issue, and then a solution proposal to describe the solution for the issue. See the numbered list below for the proposal if you would like to change something in the API:

1. Discuss an issue, bug, or discrepancy at a high-level first in the CCB
2. Request an ID for a new Change Request
3. Create the new Change Request, describe the background of the issue and reason for the request (as per the template)
4. Send it to the CCB per mail well in advance of the meeting time to allow reasonable time to read
5. The CCB discusses the change request
   a. If the change request needs to be updated, it is sent back to the original requestor for update
   b. If the change request is rejected, store it for reference
   c. If the change request is approved without any updates needed, the CCB assigns one or more persons to create a Solution Proposal. Could be the same as the one who raised the change request, or others
6. The Solution Proposal is created, detailing the solution and any considered alternative solutions (as per the template)
7. The Solution Proposal is sent to the CCB per mail well in advance of the meeting time to allow reasonable time to read
8. The CCB discusses the Solution Proposal
   a. If the Solution Proposal needs to be updated, it is sent back to the assigned persons for update
   b. If the Solution Proposal is rejected, store it for reference and update the change request status in the Change Request if there were no acceptable/possible solution to the issue
   c. If the Solution Proposal is approved without any updates needed, the CCB discusses when the update of the specification can be done and assigns one or more persons to update the specification
